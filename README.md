# RiverPlasticPollutionModel
This project was completed during my internship at Oeson Learning, in collaboration with the Global Clean Rivers Initiative (GCRI). The goal was to use data science and predictive analytics to forecast river plastic waste levels and support policy decision-making from 2015 to 2060.
